# DeepArt

## Introduction

I was walking back from my lab and suddenly stroke by an idea: What if I can create some beautiful pictures through Deep Learning?

Well, it doesn't have to be learning how to draw an artwork, the features created by Deep Neural Networks are in fact beautiful. So, a specialized network has to be trained, well, the target, I haven't thought through yet.
